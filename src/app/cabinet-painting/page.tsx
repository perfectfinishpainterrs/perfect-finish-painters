            Your kitchen cabinets take up more visual space than almost anything else in the room. If they look dated, worn, or the wrong color, it drags down the entire kitchen. Cabinet painting is the fastest, most affordable way to completely transform your kitchen without the cost and disruption of a full cabinet replacement. Perfect Finish Painters serves Mays Landing, Egg Harbor Township, Northfield, Galloway, and all of Atlantic County.

            New kitchen cabinets typically cost <strong className="text-[#1e3a5f]">$15,000 or more</strong> installed — and the project can take weeks, leaving your kitchen torn apart. Professional cabinet painting delivers the same dramatic transformation for <strong className="text-[#1e3a5f]">$1,200 to $3,500</strong>, depending on cabinet count and condition. The work takes just 2 to 4 days, and you can use your kitchen throughout most of the process. If your cabinet boxes are structurally solid, painting is the smart move — you get a fresh, modern look at a fraction of the cost.

                  We remove all doors, drawers, and hardware, then label everything for precise reinstallation. Every surface is degreased with TSP to remove years of kitchen grime, grease, and oils. We sand all surfaces by hand to create the ideal profile for paint adhesion, and fill any dents or imperfections with wood filler.

                <p className="text-[#64748b] leading-relaxed">
                  We apply a bonding primer designed specifically for cabinetry to ensure long-term adhesion. Then we apply two coats of alkyd or enamel paint that cures to a hard, durable shell — resistant to fingerprints, moisture, and daily kitchen wear. We use brushes, rollers, or spray application depending on the cabinet style to achieve a smooth, factory-quality finish.

                  Once the paint has fully cured, we reinstall all doors, drawers, and hardware — or install new hardware if you&apos;re upgrading. We adjust hinges for proper alignment and do a final walkthrough with you to make sure every detail meets your expectations.
