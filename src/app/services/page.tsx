            <p className="text-[#64748b] text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              For interior painting, most rooms in the Mays Landing area cost between $500 and $1,000 depending on room size, wall condition, and paint quality. A single room typically takes one day to complete, while a full interior takes 3 to 5 days. We use premium paints from trusted brands and always include proper surface preparation — filling holes, sanding, taping, and priming — before applying paint.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#64748b] text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              For exterior painting in South Jersey, we recommend 100% acrylic latex paints with UV and mildew resistance to stand up to the coastal humidity, salt air, and seasonal weather changes common in the Atlantic County area. We power wash surfaces, scrape and sand loose paint, apply primer to bare wood, and caulk gaps before painting. Exterior projects are quoted after a free on-site or photo-based assessment.
