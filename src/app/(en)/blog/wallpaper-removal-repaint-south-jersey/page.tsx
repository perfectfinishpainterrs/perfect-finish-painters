              A lot of South Jersey homes — especially the older housing stock in Absecon, Pleasantville, Somers Point and the shore towns — still carry wallpaper from two or three owners ago. Homeowners often start peeling a corner themselves, discover the paper fights back, and call us mid-project. That&apos;s because wallpaper removal isn&apos;t a peeling job; it&apos;s a wall-restoration job. Here&apos;s what doing it right actually looks like.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">Why Is Wallpaper So Hard to Remove in Older Homes?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Two reasons: age and layers. Adhesive that has cured on a wall for twenty or thirty years bonds to the drywall face, and many rooms have a second layer of paper hung — or painted over — on top of the first. In shore-area homes, decades of humidity cycles can fuse paper and paste into the wall surface. Pull it dry and the drywall&apos;s paper face comes with it, turning a strip job into a full skim-coat repair.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">How Do We Remove It Without Wrecking the Walls?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Patience and moisture. We score the paper, soak or steam it so the adhesive releases, and strip in stages — facing first, backing second. Then comes the step most DIY jobs skip: washing the glue residue off completely. Paint applied over leftover paste will crackle, fisheye or peel, sometimes months later. Once the walls are clean and dry, we repair gouges and seams, skim-coat where the surface needs it, sand smooth, and prime with a sealing primer so the new paint has a proper foundation. It&apos;s the same wall-first approach we bring to <Link href="/drywall-repair" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">drywall repair</Link> — the finish is only as good as what&apos;s under it.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">What Does the Repaint Change?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Everything about how the room reads. Wallpaper — even tasteful wallpaper — dates a room to the year it was hung. A smooth, properly primed wall in a current color instantly modernizes kitchens, baths and hallways, and it&apos;s one of the highest-impact updates per dollar for anyone prepping a home for sale in Atlantic County&apos;s active market. For humid rooms we spec moisture-resistant paint and the right sheen so the new finish lasts; our <Link href="/blog/difference-between-flat-and-satin-paint-finish" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">flat vs. satin guide</Link> explains those choices.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">Should You DIY It or Call a Pro?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              If a test corner peels off dry in big clean sheets, a careful homeowner can manage a small room. If the paper tears, shreds, or takes drywall face with it — stop. Repairing torn drywall costs more than having the whole job done professionally from the start.
