              Permanent outdoor lighting is having its moment in South Jersey, and a lot of trades are suddenly offering installs — electricians, handymen, holiday-light crews. Here&apos;s the thing most homeowners don&apos;t consider: a Govee permanent lighting system is, physically, a long aluminum track fastened to your fascia boards. It&apos;s an exterior trim project. And nobody spends more days working fascia, soffit and trim than a painting crew.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">What Makes Fascia Work Different?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Fascia boards look simple from the ground and rarely are. They&apos;re often the first wood on a house to rot, the first paint to peel, and the first place carpenter bees and squirrels do quiet damage. We inspect and repair fascia on nearly every <Link href="/exterior-painting" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">exterior painting</Link> job, so when we mount a lighting channel we know immediately whether we&apos;re screwing into sound wood or into a board that needs attention first. An installer who doesn&apos;t work trim for a living fastens track into soft fascia, and the whole run sags by spring.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">Why Does Color-Matching Decide the Whole Look?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The number-one fear homeowners have about permanent lighting is how the track looks in daylight — and the answer comes down to color. Matching an aluminum channel to trim is a paint-and-color decision, and that&apos;s our home turf. We match the channel to your fascia the way we&apos;d match a touch-up: against the actual board, in actual daylight, accounting for sheen. Done right, the track disappears into the shadow line under your shingles and the house looks completely normal until dusk.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">What Does Our Install Include?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Roofline measurement and run planning, aluminum channel fastened with white-head stainless screws, concealed low-voltage cable routing, sealed penetrations, a weatherproof controller mounted by your exterior outlet, and full Govee Home app setup — scenes, schedules and all. The complete walkthrough, materials list and FAQs are on our <Link href="/govee-permanent-lighting" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">Govee permanent lighting page</Link>. Every penetration gets sealed with the same exterior-grade care we bring to caulking a paint job, because at the shore, water always finds sloppy work.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mt-10 mb-4">When Is the Right Time to Book?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Late summer and early fall. Install slots disappear once the first cold snap reminds everyone that December is coming, and an early install means your lighting is tested and dialed in long before the holidays. We install across Atlantic County — <Link href="/painters-egg-harbor-township-nj" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">Egg Harbor Township</Link>, <Link href="/painters-galloway-nj" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">Galloway</Link>, <Link href="/painters-brigantine-nj" className="text-[#2563eb] underline hover:text-[#1d4ed8] transition-colors">Brigantine</Link> and beyond.
