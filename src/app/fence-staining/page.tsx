A typical 100-foot privacy fence runs $600–$1,500. We always provide a free measured estimate before starting — call 609-377-4226." } },
      { "@type": "Question", name: "How long does fence stain last in South Jersey?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Semi-transparent stains on South Jersey fences typically last 2–4 years, solid stains 4–7 years. Fences facing south take more sun and fade faster. Shore-area fences exposed to salt air need restaining sooner than inland fences. We use penetrating stains designed for the coastal climate." } },
      { "@type": "Question", name: "Stain or paint my fence?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Stain almost every time. Paint peels on fences because wood expands and contracts with humidity, and each panel has end-grain exposed to rain. Stain soaks in and fades rather than peels — it ages gracefully instead of looking chipped. We only recommend paint when a fence has been painted before and the old finish can't be fully stripped." } },
      { "@type": "Question", name: "When is the best time to stain a fence in NJ?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Late spring through early fall, with 2–3 days of dry weather on either side of the job. May, June, and September are ideal — warm enough for the stain to cure, not so hot that it dries before penetrating. We avoid staining wet wood, so we'll reschedule after rain." } },
      { "@type": "Question", name: "Can you stain a brand-new pressure-treated fence?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Not immediately. New pressure-treated lumber needs to dry out 3–6 months before stain will soak in properly. Staining too early is why new fences often look blotchy within a year. For cedar fences, you can stain much sooner — typically within a few weeks of install." } },
      { "@type": "Question", name: "Do you handle both privacy fences and picket fences?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes. We stain and paint privacy fences, picket fences, split-rail, post-and-rail, and fence gates. Each style has different surface area and prep demands — we quote based on actual linear footage and complexity, not a flat per-panel rate." } },

                A fence is one of the largest wooden surfaces on most South Jersey properties — and one of the most neglected. Untreated, wood fences gray out and crack in 1–2 seasons. Painted fences peel. Stained fences, done right, age quietly and last decades. We stain, seal, and occasionally paint cedar, pressure-treated, and picket fences across Atlantic County.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[#64748b] text-lg mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                Typical fence staining in the Mays Landing area runs <strong className="text-[#1e3a5f]">$3–$8 per linear foot</strong>, so a standard 100-foot privacy fence usually lands between $600 and $1,500. Old finish stripping and repair add to the cost but extend the next stain job by years.
